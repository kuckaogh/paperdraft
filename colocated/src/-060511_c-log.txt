-06012001-correct erraneous height and buffer - due to uncessarily receding at the first step.
          add step and time to log.txt

-05121902-reset pp in velocity subroutine to remove residual effect of poisson solver

-05122010-smaller buffer closer result
          Checked those assgin functions, MAX of either values is used.
          However, they are not the point, the major factor is the buffer.
          with smaller buffer, the result is closer to the same resolution case.
