\section{Summary}


A unsteady non-hydrostatic flow model is constructed. The governing equation is derived from the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation. The spatial discretization is implemented in structured rectangular grids with both staggered and colocated arrangements. The spatial discretization is implemented in fixed-structured rectangular grids with both staggered and colocated arrangements. The free surface is tracked with a separate function which integrates the velocity field of the vertical column. The time integration employs the forward Euler, 4th-order Runge-Kutta, and the 4-step 3rd-order Strong-Stability-Preserving Runge-Kutta method. The pressure-Poisson equation resulted from the incompressible assumption is solved with the successive-over-relaxation Gauss-Seidel method and the multigrid method, which generally uses the SOR Gauss-Seidel method as the element for each grid level. The velocity advection and diffusion terms use the central difference discretization. The salinity transport uses the constrained-interpolation-profile method proposed by Yabe et al. \cite{Yabe1991A, Yabe1991B, Yabe01}. This unsteady non-hydrostatic flow model is used as a testbed for the proposed adjustable non-hydrostatic method and the receding boundary method for domain decompositions.
