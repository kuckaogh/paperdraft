The Prandtl number is a dimensionless parameter of a convecting system that characterizes the regime of convection. It is defined as

where is the kinematic viscosity and is the thermal diffusivity. In order of increasing Prandtl number, modes of convection are as follows.

    1. Rolls,
    2. Three-dimensional steady pattern in which flow occurs in interlocking polygons which are often hexagons or squares,
    3. Irregularly shaped cells,
    4. Narrow rising regions characterized by isothermal circulation, and
    5. Turbulent convection in which no cells are present.
