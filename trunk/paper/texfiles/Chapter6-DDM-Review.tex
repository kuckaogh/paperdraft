\section{Domain Decomposition for Incompressible Flow Simulation}

The domain decomposition method is a divide-and-conquer strategy. The advection, diffusion, batotropic, and the reduced gravity terms are designed to be solved explicitly, the solution for the hydrodynamic pressure is the only implicit part.
