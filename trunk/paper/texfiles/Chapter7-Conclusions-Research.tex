\section{Future Researches}

\begin{description}

\item [Parallel Computation]

The receding boundary method enables the independent solutions in the subdomains and the communications between subdomains are not required until the boundaries reset. The parallel version of this method is expected to take this advantage over the serial version. MPICH \cite{Gropp1996, MPICH2}, an implementation of Message Passing interface \cite{MPI1995}, can be employed to extend the current model.

\item [Variable Grid Scale]

The hydrodynamics of bodies of water spans wide spatial and temporal spectra. Modeling full scale hydrodynamic phenomena is the everlasting dream of researchers. However, a more practical approach is adjusting the grid scale depending on the required simulation resolutions for subdomains. This capability of variable grid scale will be incorporated into the receding boundary method.

\item [Three-dimensional and Turbulence Modeling]

The three-dimensional flow model with turbulence dynamics is still under development. The transition from two-dimensional model to three-dimensional one is not trivial but can increase the model applicability to a wider range of geophysical fluid dynamics.
