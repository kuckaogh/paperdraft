Adjustable non-hydrostatic method is proposed for numerical simulations of geophysical internal flows. This method combines the non-hydrostatic pressure computation and the incompressibility correction of hydrostatic models. The number of iterations or the accuracy of the non-hydrostatic pressure computation are adjustable, providing the flexibility to balance the accuracy requirement and the computational cost.

Receding boundary method is proposed to lessen the massive communications between parallel elements with the tradeoff of approximating the pressure Poisson equation. The numerical experiment of gravity current shows that this approximating method can reduce the communications from more than one per iteration step to one communication for every ten iteration steps while maintaining the result with satisfactory accuracy.
