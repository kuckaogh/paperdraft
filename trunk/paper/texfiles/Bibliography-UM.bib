    Abstract       = {The constant initial speed of propagation (V) of heavy gravity currents, of density PC, released from behind a lock and along the bottom boundary of a tank containing a linearly stratified fluid has been measured experimentally and calculated numerically. The density difference, bottom to top, of the stratification is (rho(b) - rho(0)) and its intrinsic frequency is N. For a given ratio of the depth of released fluid (h) to total depth (H) it has been found that the dimensionless internal Froude number, Fr = V/NH, is independent of the length of the lock and is a logarithmic function of a parameter R = (rho(C) - rho(0))/(rho(b) - rho(0)), except at small values of h/H and R close to unity. This parameter, R, is one possible measure of the relative strength of the current (rho(C) - rho(0)) and stratification (rho(b)-rho(0)). The distance propagated by the current before this constant velocity regime ended (X-tr), scaled by h, has been found to be a unique function of Fr for all states tested. After this phase of the motion, for subcritical values of Fr, i.e. less than 1/pi, internal wave interactions with the current resulted in an oscillation of the velocity of its leading edge. For supercritical values, velocity decay was monotonic for the geometries tested. A two-dimensional numerical model incorporating a no-slip bottom boundary condition has been found to agree with the experimental velocity magnitudes to within +/-1.5%.},

    Abstract       = {A very common procedure when constructing boundary conditions for the time-dependent Navier-Stokes equations at artificial boundaries is to extrapolate the solution from grid points near the boundary to the boundary itself. For supersonic outflow, where all the characteristic variables leave the computational domain, this leads to accurate results. In the case of subsonic outflow, where one characteristic variable enters the computational domain, one cannot in general expect accurate solutions by this procedure, The problem with outflow boundary operators of extrapolation type at artificial boundaries with errors in the boundary data of order one will be investigated. Both the problem when the artificial outflow boundary is located in essentially uniform flow and the situation when the artificial outflow boundary is located in a flow field with large gradients are discussed. It will be shown, that in the special case when there are large gradients tangential to the boundary, extrapolation methods can be used even in the subsonic case. (C) 1995 Academic Press, Inc.}
