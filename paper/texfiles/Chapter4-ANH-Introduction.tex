A numerical technique is presented to balance the accuracy requirement and the computational cost for numerical simulations of geophysical flows. This adjustable non-hydrostatics method first compute the non-hydrostatic pressure based on the requirement of maximum divergence error or number of iterations, followed by the vertical velocity correction from the continuity equation.
