The relationship between the numerical simulations and the physical phenomena is not axiomatic, thus a numerical model is generally evaluated using empirical data and/or the validation on known analytical solutions. The discrepancy between the numerical and experimental results depends on the numerical approximation, the round-off and truncation errors of the computer limitation, the model parameters specification, and the experimental data accuracy. The complete identification of those different factors is the ultimate goal of a fully optimized numerical model, and the improvement will be pursued through continuous effort after the initial demonstration of the adjustable non-hydrostatic method and the receding boundary method.

In this chapter, the analytical solutions of the standing wave and solitary wave are used to compare the numerical results of the free-surface non-hydrostatic model. The gravity current experiment \cite{Maxworthy02} is also tested numerically with different grid resolutions and different grid arrangements, i.e., colocated grid and staggered grid.
