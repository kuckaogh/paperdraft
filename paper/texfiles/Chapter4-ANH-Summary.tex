\section{Summary}

The adjustable non-hydrostatics is a approximate numerical technique to balance the accuracy requirement and the computational cost for geophysical flow simulations. This method combines the partial computation of hydrodynamic pressure and the continuity correction of hydrostatic models. The gravity current simulations of two- and three-dimensional are tested with varying stopping criteria. This numerical test turns out to be encouraging, providing a capability to balance the accuracy requirement and the computational cost. However, a more rigorous analysis is needed in the future study to better understand the performance of this technique.
