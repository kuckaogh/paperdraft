According to Merriam Webster Dictionary, the term "decomposition" means to separate into constituent parts or elements or into simpler compounds; one of the definition for "domain" is a region distinctively marked by some physical feature.

Mathematically, "decomposition" means a rewriting of a given quantity in terms of a combination of simpler quantities; "domain" means the set for which a function is defined, a connected open set in topology, or a commutative ring that has an identity element but zero divisors \cite{Weisstein}.

Here domain decomposition methods are referred to the techniques for dividing numerical problems into smaller parts, solving each piece, and then, if wished, merging them back to assemble the whole solution. Comprehensive reviews of the domain decomposition method for partial differential equations can be found in the references \cite{Toselli05, Quarteroni1999}.
